# nflgame_stats


This is a collection of methods built to scrape and format data from Burnt Sushi's nflgame python library.

My scripts use a combination of the provided methods and some knowledge of json to grab the data from nflgame center.

Please feel free to use for projects in the future. All of the code is done in python2.7.

The data here will be used to calculate probabilities and density functions of interesting nfl stats and be used in the future to 
make educated guesses about the performance of certain players.
